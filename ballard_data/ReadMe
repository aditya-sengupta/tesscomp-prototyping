Description of contents: Set of 2D TESS mission completeness functions

    Completeness_0.3Msun.fits
    Completeness_0.3Msun.npy
    Completeness_0.4Msun.fits
    Completeness_0.4Msun.npy
    Completeness_0.5Msun.fits
    Completeness_0.5Msun.npy

    Completeness file(s) corresponding to 0.3M_sun contains 17 columns, 13 rows, and each cell is a 353 element array.
    Completeness file(s) corresponding to 0.4M_sun contains 17 columns, 13 rows, and each cell is a 317 element array.
    Completeness file(s) corresponding to 0.5M_sun contains 17 columns, 13 rows, and each cell is a 333 element array. 

    In addition there are two FITS image arrays describing the columns
        (radius) and rows (period) of these arrays. More information on 
        these values is given in the additional comments.
    
        period_array.fits
        radius_array.fits

System requirements: The FITS versions of the completeness functions are
    standard FITS binary tables (data in HDU=1). The XY arrays for radius
    and period are standard FITS image arrays.

Additional comments: Each 17x13 array is a completeness function, giving the
    detection probability as a function of planetary radius (17 values in
    equal log spacing from -1.22 to 1.33, corresponding to radii from
    0.8--3.8 R_Earth) and orbital period (13 values in equal log spacing
    from -0.22 to 5.77, corresponding to orbital periods from 0.8 to 322.8
    days). For each of the three stellar masses, each 17x13 array is drawn
    from the completeness posterior distribution. The range in the
    completeness value in each cell reflects the uncertainty in the
    detection completeness at that radius and orbital period.
